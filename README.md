# C02 Monitoring App Prototype
 ## Currently updating the prototype to meet my current standards. 

Carbon Dioxide Monitoring App
In our recent assignment, we embarked on a comprehensive user experience (UX) process to design an app that showcased the carbon dioxide (CO2) levels at various buildings within the University of Guelph. This project was not only an exercise in UX design but also a practical application of data visualization and communication for a real-world scenario.

Understanding the Problem

The primary objective of the app was to provide students and professors with access to real-time data on CO2 levels in different university buildings. High CO2 levels can indicate poor ventilation, which is crucial information, especially in shared indoor spaces. Our task was to create an app that not only displayed this data but also made it easy to understand and share.

Research and Discovery

We began by conducting thorough research to understand the needs and expectations of our potential users. This involved interviewing students, professors, and facility management staff to gather insights into their preferences and requirements for such an app. We also analyzed existing apps and platforms that provided similar functionalities to identify best practices and potential areas for improvement.

Design and Prototyping

Armed with our research findings, we moved on to the design phase. We created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the app's layout and functionality. The app needed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a focus on clear data visualization. We incorporated graphs and charts to display the CO2 levels in an easy-to-understand format. Additionally, we included features that allowed users to generate reports and share them with others, promoting transparency and collaboration within the university community.

Testing and Iteration

User testing was a crucial step in the process. We conducted usability tests with students and professors to gather feedback on the app's design and functionality. Based on this feedback, we made several iterations to improve the user experience. We refined the app's navigation, enhanced the visual design, and added new features based on user suggestions.

Final Product

The final app was a testament to our dedication to creating a user-centric design. It provided users with real-time data on CO2 levels in university buildings, displayed in visually appealing graphs and charts. Users could easily generate reports and share them with others, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. The app was designed to be accessible and intuitive, catering to a wide range of users within the university community.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our UX process for the CO2 monitoring app was a valuable learning experience. It taught us the importance of user research, iterative design, and usability testing in creating a successful app. By focusing on the needs of our users and incorporating their feedback throughout the process, we were able to create a functional and user-friendly app that met the requirements of our assignment and provided a valuable tool for the University of Guelph community.
